            <h3>CHOCOLATE HILLS</h3>
            <p>
                The Chocolate Hills are typically a group of extraordinarily shaped hills found in the Central Visayas region, an island of Bohol, in the Philippines. 
                This magnificent landscape is unique only to this small island. 
                It is discovered that the famed hills are not only two or three, but there are more than 1,779 cone and dome-shaped hills, 
                making a strange geological formation that has left many geologists baffling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hills are scattered over an area of fifty square kilometers or more. 
                It is amazing to note that these unique hills are almost uniform in shape and their height varies between 30 and 120 meters high. 
                They are only covered with coarse grass and during the dry season (that is time between February to May) the vegetation withers because of the extreme heat from the sun, 
                turning the color from green to brown. As seen from far, the grass looks chocolaty due to withering, hence its name!

            <h3>CABOGNAW CAVE POOL</h3>
            <p>
                Cabagnow Cave is a cave pool in Anda, Bohol. 
                It holds the record of being the deepest and biggest from among five other cave pools found in this southeastern part of the province.
                The deepest portions of the cave pool are approximately 20 to 25 feet and the shallow parts maybe about 12 feet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anda is mostly covered by limestones, which have accumulated over time, dating back to millions of years. 
                Just like in many parts of Bohol, Anda has several caves that have been formed because of seawater filtering through the soft limestone rocks growing in the area. 
                Due to the soft and porous nature of limestone, water coming from the mountains seeps in the caves before flowing into the seas. 
                This makes Cabagnow Cave similar to the cenotes of Central America, which are natural pits or sinkholes that are connected to the sea.

                It is naturally lighted cavern with a deep lagoon and many large stalactites and stalagmites. 
                It is made of limestone and the cave is lit by sunlight which filters through holes in the ceiling. 
                The underground lake is very popular for swimming, so if you would visit theplace, make sure to bring swimming attire.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cave is about 100 metres long of wonderful rock formations. 
                The cave is slippery, but of course, there’s a railing made by rope to hold on to avoid accident so there is nothing to be worry. 
                Inside the cave, there is a lagoon with greenish surface produced by the green limestone at the bottom of the pool. 
                This place is really an interesting place to visit with friends, families and love ones.

            </p>
            <p>
                Originally constructed using just ropes and bamboos, today, the rope has made way to steel cables, giving added stability and security. 
                The deck of the bridge is still created out of woven bamboo slats. In places some of these appear broken but it’s still sturdy enough to take the weight of tourists.
            </p>
            <p> Of course, walking on the bridge will still let you feel side to sideways and up and down bounce. 
                But it would really make you feel safe with the steel cables so you don’t have to worry on it. 
                On not that so far side on the bridge, you will be able to find a small shop selling souvenir items.
